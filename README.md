## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Scss syntax
- Javascript for interactivity

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned after various attempts to implement the Javascript code necessary to calculate the age, it was not easy, especially to manage, not only the actual calculation based on the date of birth provided, but also to include everyone possible errors due to incorrect data entry by the user.

I added an error warning not foreseen by the design provided, in the situation where the wrong year is written in the "Years" box, i.e. NOT with 4 digits as it should be. In the original design, there was only one error if you typed a future year!

Overall I learned a lot with this challenge just because it wasn't easy and it gave me a way to manage the logic behind a "simple" task like calculating age.

### Continued development

Just after doing this challenge, I realize that I have to continue more and more with the use of Javascript to refine and speed up (not too much) the learning process of this language, because I still don't feel 100% at ease therefore ..keep learning ;)
